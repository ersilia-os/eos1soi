Title: Antimicrobial activity against non-growing bacteria
Description: Persistant infections require treatment that can kill slow and non-growing
  bacterial populations. The authors of this publication screen a library of approved
  drugs and drug candidates (Prestwick Library and Specs Repurposing Library) and
  identify 37 compounds that kill non-growing uropathogenic E.coli (UPEC). The active
  compounds delay the growth of the bacteria at pH 7.4. They belong mostly to antibiotic
  classes with a majority of fluoroquinolones. We have used this data to train a model
  using LazyQSAR.
