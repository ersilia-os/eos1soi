Title: Antimicrobial activity against non-growing bacteria
Description: Persistant infections require treatment that can kill slow and 
  non-growing bacterial populations. The authors of this publication screen a 
  library of approved drugs and drug candidates (Prestwick Library and Specs 
  Repurposing Library) and identify 37 compounds that kill non-growing 
  uropathogenic E.coli (UPEC). The active compounds delay the growth of the 
  bacteria at pH 7.4. They belong mostly to antibiotic classes with a majority 
  of fluoroquinolones. We have used this data to train a model using LazyQSAR.
